# Super Easy Selfbot for beginners With Loads of commands! Easy setup

simple stuff just make sure you read the disclaimer? also skip these steps if you are doing this on repl.it

first step if you are doing this on your pc is installing modules. simply do..
```
npm i
```
after npm i, open up index.js and on the very top put your token inbetween the quotes.
make sure you dont edit the prefix. im too busy to edit some commands that use /command instead of prefix + commands. sorry :/ simply do..
```
node .
```
To start and thats it!

**Enjoy The selfbot**
